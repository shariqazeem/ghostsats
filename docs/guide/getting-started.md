# Getting Started

## Prerequisites

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 20+ | Frontend, relayer, Telegram bot |
| npm | Package management |
| [Scarb](https://docs.swmansion.com/scarb/) | Cairo package manager and compiler |
| [snforge](https://foundry-rs.github.io/starknet-foundry/) | Starknet testing framework |
| [Nargo](https://noir-lang.org/) | Noir ZK circuit compiler |
| [Barretenberg](https://github.com/AztecProtocol/aztec-packages) (`bb`) | ZK prover (server-side) |
| [Garaga](https://github.com/keep-starknet-strange/garaga) | Starknet calldata generator |

## Smart Contracts

```bash
cd contracts
scarb build        # Compile Cairo contracts
snforge test       # Run 52 tests
```

All 52 contract tests cover deposits, withdrawals, batch execution, Merkle tree operations, ZK proof verification, intent escrow, and privacy guarantees.

## ZK Circuit

```bash
cd circuits/ghostsats
nargo test         # Run circuit tests
nargo compile      # Compile to ACIR
nargo execute      # Generate witness (with Prover.toml)
```

## Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev            # Starts on http://localhost:3000
```

The frontend includes an **embedded relayer** as Next.js API routes under `/api/relayer/`. This handles gasless withdrawals, batch execution, calldata conversion, and BTC intent relay without requiring a separate relayer service.

**Live app:** [https://theveilprotocol.vercel.app](https://theveilprotocol.vercel.app)

## Relayer and Keeper (scripts/)

For standalone relayer and keeper operation outside of the embedded API routes:

```bash
cd scripts
cp .env.example .env   # Add PRIVATE_KEY, ACCOUNT_ADDRESS
npm install
npm run relayer        # Starts standalone relayer on http://localhost:3001
npm run keeper         # Run batch execution keeper
```

The standalone relayer exposes:
- `POST /prove` -- Generate a ZK proof (nargo, bb, garaga pipeline)
- `POST /relay` -- Submit a gasless withdrawal transaction
- `GET /health` -- Health check with fee configuration

## Telegram Bot

```bash
cd scripts
cp .env.example .env   # Add TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN, POOL_ADDRESS
npm install
npm run bot            # Start the Telegram bot
```

Required environment variables:
- `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` -- Obtain from [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) on Telegram
- `POOL_ADDRESS` -- ShieldedPool contract address (auto-read from `deployment.json` if available)
- `WEB_APP_URL` -- Frontend URL for deep links (default: `http://localhost:3000`)

## Using the App

### 1. Connect Wallets

Connect both:
- **Starknet wallet** (Argent or Braavos) -- for deposits and receiving WBTC
- **Bitcoin wallet** (Xverse) -- for Bitcoin identity attestation and receiving native BTC

### 2. Shield (Deposit)

1. Go to the **Shield** tab
2. Select a denomination ($1 / $10 / $100 USDC)
3. Approve USDC spending
4. Confirm the deposit transaction
5. **Save your encrypted note** -- you will need it for withdrawal

### 3. Wait for Batch Execution

The keeper aggregates deposits and executes a batch USDC-to-WBTC swap using live BTC pricing from CoinGecko. This happens periodically or can be triggered via the embedded relayer API.

### 4. Unveil (Withdraw)

1. Go to the **Unveil** tab
2. Load your encrypted note
3. Choose your withdrawal mode:
   - **WBTC on Starknet** -- enter a Starknet recipient address
   - **Native BTC (intent settlement)** -- enter a Bitcoin address; a solver sends BTC directly
4. Optionally enable **gasless withdrawal** (relayer pays gas)
5. The app generates a ZK proof (in-browser via bb.js WASM, or server-side)
6. Submit the withdrawal transaction
7. Assets are sent to the recipient address

### 5. AI Strategist

1. Go to the **Strategist** tab
2. Type a natural language instruction describing your goal:
   - `"Accumulate $50 in BTC, maximize privacy"`
   - `"DCA $50 over 5 deposits"`
   - `"Invest $200, spread across all pools"`
   - `"Quick $10 deposit, minimize gas"`
3. Watch the agent's real-time thinking log as it analyzes pool state and BTC price
4. Review the generated execution plan (steps, tiers, delays, estimated BTC, privacy score)
5. Approve and execute with a single wallet confirmation

### 6. Telegram Bot

Use the Telegram bot for mobile strategy planning:
- `/strategy Accumulate $50 in BTC, maximize privacy` -- streams a thinking log and generates a strategy
- `/status` -- pool state and BTC price
- `/price` -- live BTC with per-tier conversion rates
- `/pool` -- detailed protocol analytics with a link to view the contract on [Voyager](https://sepolia.voyager.online)

Tap the **"Execute on Web"** button in the bot's response to deep-link into the web app with the strategy pre-loaded.

### 7. Comply (Optional)

Use the **Comply** tab to:
- Register a view key for your deposit
- Export a compliance proof (JSON) for regulators
